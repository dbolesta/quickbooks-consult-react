                I approached Linda in 2017 after making a mess of my
                Quickbooks Online® company&#39;s chart of accounts. I
                had no idea how to capture the true income deducting
                out the artist consignments and I couldn&#39;t track
                the credit card income minus the fees. My payroll
                reports are complicated and unreadable making
                liabilities hard to track.
                <span class='client-quote-highlight'
                  >Linda is fabulous!</span
                >
                She straightened out my previous year&#39;s accounts
                and created an understandable consignment tracking
                schedule. She diligently maintains my monthly
                reconciliations and breaks out each payroll report
                into trackable liabilities. (Including pointing out
                miscalculations by my payroll company during 2018 Q2.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I am indebted to Linda for organizing and maintaining
                my accounts on Quickbooks®.

                Brightside is a small, non-profit 501(c)3 facility in
                Bergen County, NJ. Linda was hired in 2015 to
                negotiate through a nightmare accounts receivable
                issue with Medicare. During the Affordable Care Act
                transition, there was a halt of what had been
                systematic Medicare payments. Suddenly baffling
                threads of inexplicable credits were outweighed by
                unauthorized debits, critically affecting our bank
                balances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Linda managed to untangle the financial tracking per
                patient. She wanted to utilize Quickbooks® as the
                conduit for tracking, but due to investigative
                accountability (Brightside uses Quickbooks® for our
                financial reports and a “second” company file may have
                raised audit concerns), Linda used Excel® for her
                tracking creating a financial database thread for each
                patient. Although the information took longer to input
                in this manner, Linda’s file allowed Brightside to
                resolve this financially restrictive matter. With
                Linda’s diligence we had a map of all the payments
                still owed to us.

                As owner of a small business, I began using
                Quickbooks® in the 1990’s until the company was sold
                in 2013. Although not set up for equipment rental,
                <span class='client-quote-highlight'
                  >the program is malleable and able to adapt to any
                  industry</span
                >. I designed a system able to follow rentals. As the
                company grew, Quickbooks® made financial tracking
                easier allowing me more time to focus on my executive
                duties. Once a bookkeeper was hired, Intuit’s security
                options allowed for lower level employee input of
                information without access to more sensitive reports
                and numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Owning a successful company was assisted by the
                Quickbooks® small business accounting program and the
                financial education it provides. I hope to take this
                knowledge and help others get the full benefit of all
                the advantages Quickbooks® has to offer.

                TMG is investing in Eugene’s future. A vibrant town
                with history, Eugene has so much to offer. Three Muses
                Group has been successful in the gentrification of
                several neighborhoods and we are moving forward with
                several new projects in areas with potential that we
                are excited about. TMG is currently involved in
                several real estate projects – residential units,
                restaurants, commercial and office space. This leaves
                little time for proper bookkeeping. Although we are a
                small entity, our accounts are complicated and our
                accountant insisted we organize our finances. We have
                hired Linda to track several company files. During a
                very productive meeting with our accountant, Linda
                showed her obvious talents and we knew we had hired
                the right person to do the job.
              </p>
              <p>
                On Quickbooks®, Linda has created trackable accounts
                for each entity, and has been producing monthly
                reconciliations, quarterly, and annual reports for our
                accountant.
                <span class='client-quote-highlight'
                  >For the first time in years, our financials are to
                  date.</span
                >
                We are so appreciative of Linda’s ability to
                understand our multi-layered procedures, her attention
                to detail, her knowledge of the financial process and
                small business practices. I would recommend Linda
                without hesitation.

                Although our bookkeeping set-up had been on
                Quickbooks®, the chart of accounts and system of
                recording income and expenses was lacking in
                organization, making the reports too difficult to read
                or understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Linda was terrific. She understood what needed to be
                done and quickly provided a cohesive chart of
                accounts. She was able to explain to our new Treasurer
                the ins and outs of the Quickbooks® program.
                <span class='client-quote-highlight'
                  >She offered many tips on small business procedures

                The church is now able to input accounts payable and
                record split income categories allowing us to print
                out clear and concise P&L statements. For the first
                time, we are now able to set up proper spending
                budgets! The clarity of our financials is giving us
                the ability to cut back on expenses and know where the
                individual sources of income are coming from, and
                going to.

                St. John is grateful for Linda’s services and we
                highly recommend her talents to any small business for
                assistance in the Quickbooks® program and proper
                bookkeeping strategies.

                1980’s. When he moved into assisted living in 2018 at

                and structured his Quickbook® files to reflect his
                own, rather odd, way of thinking. He calls her several
                times a week to “find out his bank balance”, but I
                know he just likes to speak to her. I hear him
                laughing and comfortable. I receive monthly
                reconciliations from her, keeping me on top of dad’s
                situation.
